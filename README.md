## 🚀 About Me

I’m Marc Thomas, a life-long learner. I’m enthusiastic about all things Big Data or as I like to put it ‘I’m a Big Big Data Enthusiast‘. I find joy in piecing together intricate details to comprehend the big picture.

Beyond the world of data, I find solace in playing the piano 🎹 and guitar 🎸 and experimenting with problems from quantum to cosmos. Documentaries are my go-to for leisure 📺, and I have a knack for solving puzzles 🧩, even though my impatience sometimes leads me to peek at the solutions. Feel free to explore my projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out to me via email. Let’s connect!
