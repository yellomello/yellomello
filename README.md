Hello World, I'm Marc 👋

🚀 About Me
I’m Marc Thomas, a life-long learner. I’m enthusiastic about all things Big Data or as I like to put it ‘I’m a Big Big Data Enthusiast‘. I find joy in piecing together intricate details to comprehend the big picture.
Beyond the world of data, I find solace in playing the piano and guitar and experimenting with problems from quantum to cosmos. Documentaries are my go-to for leisure, and I have a knack for solving puzzles, even though my impatience sometimes leads me to peek at the solutions. Feel free to explore my projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out to me via email. Let’s connect!
